                    <div class="topic">Coding Is My Passion</div>
                    <p>Coding is my passion because it allows me to turn ideas into real, functional applications that help people. 
                       I enjoy solving problems through logical thinking and creativity, and I find satisfaction in seeing my code come to life whether it’s a responsive website or a mobile app. 
                       Every project I build helps me grow as a developer and motivates me to keep learning new technologies.
                    </p>

                    <div class="topic1">Continuous Learning Is My Goal</div>
                    <p>Continuous learning is my goal because technology is always evolving, and I want to stay ahead by constantly improving my skills. 
                       I enjoy exploring new frameworks like React and Angular, and I believe that every project is an opportunity to grow not only as a developer but also as a problem solver. 
                       I see learning as a lifelong journey that helps me adapt, innovate, and contribute effectively to any team I’m part of.
